To do this, we will use a nested *for loop*. This means we will have an outer `for` loop that counts over the different values of R and then an inner `for` loop that counts over the different values of A for a particular value of R. As we calculate the energies at each angle for a particular value of R, we will save the values in a list called `energies_R` as we did before. Once we have finished all the angles for a particular R, we will append the list `energies_R` to a list called `energy_2D`. This means `energy_2D` will be a list of lists.
