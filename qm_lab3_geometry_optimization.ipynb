You will need to add in the charge, multiplicity, and coordinates of your molecule in order for Psi4 to know what all of the atoms are and where they are in relation to each other. Once we have the molecule built, we can use Psi4 to calculate different attributes of the molecule using the basis set that we specify. In this case we will use the Hartree-Fock method (SCF) and the cc-pVDZ basis set. We will calculate the energy of the molecule and print it to a file called 'energy_initial', since this is the initial structure of our molecule. It turns out that this command gives us more than just the molecule's energy.\n",
