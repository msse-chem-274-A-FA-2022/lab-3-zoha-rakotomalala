    "## Definitions\n",
    "**Potential Energy Surface**: the energy of a system or collection of atoms, in terms of certain parameters, normally the positions of the atoms. [reference](https://chem.libretexts.org/Courses/University_of_California_Davis/UCD_Chem_107B%3A_Physical_Chemistry_for_Life_Scientists/Chapters/2%3A_Chemical_Kinetics/2.06%3A_Potential_Energy_Surfaces).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Our goal in this exercise is to understand the way the energy of the molecule changes as we rotate the nitro group relative to the benzyl group. We could just rotate the nitro group a certain number of degrees, calculate an energy, and then repeat as many times as we need to get a decent looking plot. However, one problem with this is that the bond lengths, and perhaps other angles not associated with the rotation, may actually want to change to get to a lower energy. The best way to make sure that we are getting the lowest energy associated with the rotation is to rotate the molecule, freeze the dihedrals, and then optimize the geometry - letting all other coordinates change except the frozen dihedrals. This is called a **constrained optimization**.\n",

    "The first code block will set up our molecule as an object in Psi4 using the function `psi4.geometry`. You will need to add in the final coordinates of your molecule from the nitrobenzene optimization from the last exercises. As before, we can use Psi4 to calculate different attributes of the molecule using the basis set that we specify. In this case we will use the Hartree-Fock method (SCF) and the cc-pVDZ basis set to calculate the energy of the molecule and store it in a value E for printing in the notebook when the calculation is complete. It is useful to check to make sure that this energy is the same as the one from the final geometry in the optimization - just to make sure that the geometry that you have put in is OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also print the positions of all the atoms at any time using `molecule.print_out_in_angstrom()` and all of the interatomic distances using `molecule.print_distances()`. We will print these to a file called ‘geometry_initial’ just as an example, but we don’t really need this information right now."

For different molecules, you may have to use a different step size for your angle rotation. But if you choose too big of a step size, the optimization may fail. If you take too small of a step, then it will take a long time to generate the calculations. In this example, we will initially rotate our dihedral angle by increments of 10 degrees.
